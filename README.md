# Group Project - *Timeline*

With our phones today, we are able to capture and share many moments in our lives. We post our updates on Facebook/Twitter/Instagram. We attach photos to our emails. We send updates via text messaging. But with the many communication mediums available to us, these memories that we once treasured are spread across many different apps and are often forgotten. Wouldn't it be great to have a way to piece these moments together and be able to look back on them a month, a year or 10 years from now?

**Timeline** is an Android app that allows a user to create stories and capture moments while sharing them only with people you care about. When a user creates a story, they can select users who can view and contribute to this story. For each story, a user can describe the moment and attach photos. It then provides a visual timeline for these moments allowing you to look back on them anytime you want. 


Here are some sample stories:
* My First Child -- Imagine creating a story that documents your new born's life -- from capturing the moment they were born, their first laugh, their first birthday, their first day of kindergarten, etc. and sharing them with your child's grandparents, aunts and uncles. The app allows family members, both near and far to never miss out on your child's important milestones. Wouldn't it be great for your family members to look back on your child's moments in one app especially when they can't be with them?

* My Honeymoon -- Imagine creating a story that documents your honeymoon with your spouse. These are intimate moments that you don't want to share in public, but still want to document the details and capture photos as they happen. Wouldn't it be great to be able to look back at this story on your 10th year anniversary?

* My Family -- Imagine creating a story that allows you and your family to share photos --  the Hawaii vacation that you all took, your mom's 50th birthday party, Christmas celebration in 2015. Wouldn't it be great to be able to look back on these moments in one app when you're feeling homesick?
